"The PLA must focus on improving its combat readiness... We have multiple ways to safeguard peace and security and prevent wars, but military means are always our last resort," he said.

In his speech, Xi looked back on the PLA's history, paths and sacrifices, saying the military has made so many historic contributions to the Party and the Chinese people.

He said the PLA's faith in the Party and its own lofty ideals, its fighting spirit and revolutionary discipline, as well as support from the people have been the foundation of its successes, adding the military must keep making reforms and innovate so it can always move forward.

He pledged to deepen the ongoing military reform, to encourage more use of science and technology in the PLA, and to push forward civil-military integration, which generally refers to the military transferring technologies to civilian sectors and commissioning private companies to produce equipment for the armed forces.
