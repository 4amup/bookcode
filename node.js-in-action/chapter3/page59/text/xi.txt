"The Chinese people love peace. We will never seek aggression or expansion, but we have the confidence to defeat all invasions," the president told the television audience and those in attendance and at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. "We will never allow any people, organization or political party to split any part of Chinese territory out of the country at any time, in any form â€¦ and no one should expect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is harmful to our sovereignty, security or development interests."
